# SourceLib
[![Build Status](https://drone.fap.no/api/badges/kradalby/talkmoresms/status.svg)](https://drone.fap.no/kradalby/talkmoresms)

**NOTE**

This is a fork of the original wrapping with some differences:

* SourceQuery.py is now Python3 compatible
* There are some test to confirm it
* I have included a setup.py file

To install and use:

    pip install git+https://github.com/kradalby/SourceLib.git

**NOTE END**


This project is unfinished and currently not under active development.
Do not expect it to be polished or bug free.
